## Naming Examples

### ✅ Good Uses
- "Echo-OS Core" (for a minimal variant)
- "Echo-OS for ROS" (specialized for robotics)
- "Echo-Shell" (a component of Echo-OS)
- "Powered by Echo-OS" (on a product)
- "Echo-OS Community Edition" (a community fork, clearly labeled)

### ❌ Problematic Uses
- "EchoOS Pro" (suggests you're the official maintainer)
- "Echo Operating System" (too similar; confuses with competitors)
- "Echo AI" (loses the OS connection; too generic)
- "MyCompany Echo-OS" (suggests corporate backing that doesn't exist)

---

## Trademark Registration

The "Echo-OS" trademark is:
- **Unregistered** as of December 22, 2025
- **Common Law Rights** protected (use establishes ownership)
- **Registration in Progress** for United States (federal)
- **Future Plans:** Expand to international registration if demand warrants

Until formal registration, we rely on:
- GitHub project visibility and documentation
- This usage policy (legally binding in most jurisdictions)
- Community awareness

---

## Academic & Research Use

Echo-OS encourages academic research. You may:

✅ Use Echo-OS in research without asking  
✅ Publish papers describing Echo-OS  
✅ Reference the name in citations  
✅ Create modified versions for experiments  

Please include a citation:
```bibtex
@software{echoos2025,
  author = {Paul, Leondas},
  title = {Echo-OS: An AI-Native Operating System},
  year = {2025},
  url = {https://github.com/sirspyr0/echo}
}
```

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use "Echo" as a company name?**  
A: Probably yes—"Echo" alone is generic. "Echo-OS" or "Echo AI Operating System" would conflict.

**Q: Can I create "Echo-OS for Windows"?**  
A: Yes, but call it something like "Echo-Core for Windows" to differentiate. "Echo-OS" specifically refers to the Linux-based vision.

**Q: Can I fork Echo-OS and call it Echo-OS v2?**  
A: No. Call it "MyProject, an Echo-OS fork" or choose a new name. "Echo-OS vX" implies continuity with the original.

**Q: What if I disagree with this policy?**  
A: Contact sirspyr0@github.com and we can discuss. Most reasonable use cases are permitted with clear labeling.

**Q: Can I trademark "Echo-OS" myself?**  
A: No. We have common law rights and are pursuing federal registration. Attempting to register would likely be challenged and rejected.
